# Sign Your Name

Write a program that automates the mouse to hold down the left button, and move around to create your signature.

When you are finished, you should be able to open a drawing program, such as Microsoft Paint, and run your program so it
draws your signature (or at least spells out your name somehow).

You'll need to use the PyAutoGUI package, so be sure to install PyAutoGUI by doing the following:
* Navigate to File > Settings, then go to Project: (project name) > Project Interpreter
* Click on the "+" icon on the far right, and then search for: PyAutoGUI
* Then click the button at the bottom: "Install Package"
 
Then you can import it at the top of your file as follows:
```
import pyautogui
```

See the folder: windows-desktop-automation for some examples.
